# Unit2-Sprint4-BuildWeek
### I went above and beyond with this Build Week
We had one weekend to finish the assessment, and learn Plotly/Dash and create a Plotly/Dash app. I was actually the only person that went above and beyond creating 3 Plotly/Dash apps. Two people did web-apps, and the rest of the class didn't turn that part in. My Plotly/Dash apps are hosted on Heroku.<br/>
This first one was just practice which consisted of a scatter plot and a map.<br/>

### The Assignment 
Take the Kaggle Life Expectancy CSV file, and wrangle the data. This consisted of cleaning the data and Feature Engineering and Encoding the data. Then we needed to split and scale the data, but we only want to scale (X), we donâ€™t want to scale what we are trying to predict (y). I used StandardScaler().<br/>
